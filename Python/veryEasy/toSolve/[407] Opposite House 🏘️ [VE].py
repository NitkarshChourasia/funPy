##Opposite House üèòÔ∏è

Nitkarsh was walking through a straight street with exactly n identical houses on both sides. House numbers in the street look like this:
___
1 |   | 6

3 |   | 4

5 |   | 2
_____

He noticed that Even numbered houses increase on the right while Odd numbered houses decrease on the left.
Create a function that takes a house number house and length of the street n and returns the house number on the opposite side.


[Examples]

___
opposite_house(1, 3) ‚ûû 6

opposite_house(2, 3) ‚ûû 5

opposite_house(3, 5) ‚ûû 8
